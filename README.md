# Overview

Open Model Manager is a new version of SAS Model Manager for data analysts using open-source modeling languages such as Python and R. Open Model Manager is a new tool to make it easy for open-source modelers to operationalize their models. In a single web-app you can manage your full model lifecycle: development, deployment, and monitoring.
The content on this site is available for users of Open Model Manager, it provides scripts and sample code that will make it easier to use Open Model Manager. It is also hoped that the community of users will use this page to share ideas, code, and models.
